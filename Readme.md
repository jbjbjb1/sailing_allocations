# Readme

A program to generate sailing allocations for camp. All names have been randomly generated. Phase 1 is working (generates allocations for entire camp).

## Usage
Run main.py, input_data.xlsx must be in the same folder. It will automatically generate sailing_allocation_output.xlsx and sailing_allocation_output_turns.xlsx.

## Requirements
Tested on Python 3.7.6 with default Andaconda installation.

## Future ideas
* (Phase 2) Allow creation of allocations for one day at a time. Allow modifications of previous day's crews "as it happened" and allow changes in boats/campers/leaders availability.
* Make this script a web app so that input_data.xlsx can be uploaded, and sailing_allocation_output.xlsx and sailing_allocation_output_turns.xlsx is returned as a download.
